# DataScienceMethodsOverview3

Exploration of two different high-dimensional data sets - a dataset of text documents, and a collection of images.

* Supervised classification (Multi Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks)
* Graph analytics (Community Detection)
* Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbours)
* Dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis, Non Negative Matrix Factorisation Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
