# Advanced Methods for Data Science

Exploration of two different high-dimensional data sets - the MNIST-Fashion dataset, and a dataset of text documents with citations. The approaches considered are:

* Supervised classification (Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks)
* Graph analytics (Community Detection)
* Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbours)
* Dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis, Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation, Latent-Dirichlet Allocation)
